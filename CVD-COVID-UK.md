# CVD-COVID-UK

## Introduction

[CVD-COVID-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/cvd-covid-uk-project/), led by Professor Cathie Sudlow, Director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Data Science Centre, is one of the National Flagship Projects approved by the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK.

CVD-COVID-UK is a collaboration of over 130 members across 40 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of principles with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.
