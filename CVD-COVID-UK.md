# CVD-COVID-UK / COVID-IMPACT

## Introduction

[CVD-COVID-UK](https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/areas/cvd-covid-uk-covid-impact/), led by Professor Angela Wood, Associate Director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Data Science Centre, is one of the [National Flagship Projects](https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/covid-19-and-cardiovascular-health) approved by the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK.

CVD-COVID-UK is a collaboration of over 400 [members](https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/010524-CVD-COVID-UK-COVID-IMPACT-Consortium-Members.pdf) across more than 50 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of [principles](http://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CVD-COVID-UK-COVID-IMPACT-principles-v3.0.pdf) with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.

Approved researchers access data within secure trusted research environments (TREs)/secure data environments (SDEs) provided by NHS England in England, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland, the SAIL Databank in Wales and the Honest Broker Service in Northern Ireland.

Linkable datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular, stroke and vascular surgical audits, maternity services and mental health.

**Expansion to COVID-IMPACT**

Building on the success of CVD-COVID-UK, the BHF Data Science Centre gained ethical and regulatory approval to broaden the scope of the programme to all COVID-related research (in NHS Englands’s SDE for England only).  This is known as COVID-IMPACT and it helps to support research projects from the wider community.
