# CVD-COVID-UK

## Introduction

[CVD-COVID-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/cvd-covid-uk-project/), led by Professor Cathie Sudlow, Director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Data Science Centre, is one of the [National Flagship Projects](https://www.bhf.org.uk/for-professionals/information-for-researchers/covid-19-and-cardiovascular-health) approved by the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK.

CVD-COVID-UK is a collaboration of over 250 [members](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220202-CVD-COVID-UK-COVID-IMPACT-Consortium-Members-1.pdf) across more than 50 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of [principles](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CVD-COVID-UK-principles-for-website.pdf) with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.
