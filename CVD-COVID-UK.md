# CVD-COVID-UK

## Introduction

[CVD-COVID-UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/cvd-covid-uk-project/), led by Professor Cathie Sudlow, Director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Data Science Centre, is one of the National Flagship Projects approved by the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated healthcare datasets across the four nations of the UK.

CVD-COVID-UK is a collaboration of over 160 [members](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210330-CVD-COVID-UK-Consortium-Members.pdf) across 40 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of [principles](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CVD-COVID-UK-principles-for-website.pdf) with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.
