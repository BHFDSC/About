# BHF Data Science Centre

## Introduction

The [BHF Data Science Centre](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/bhf-data-science-centre/) is a partnership between [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) (HDR UK) and the British Heart Foundation (BHF), and sits within HDR UK.

We work with a wide range of partners including patients, public, clinicians, researchers and NHS organisations to help them carry out research using health data into the causes, prevention and treatment of all diseases of the heart and circulation (such heart attacks, stroke and vascular dementia). We do this to ensure new advances in treatment and care for diseases of the heart and circulation get to the patient as quickly as possible.

## Data sharing

All code arising from the BHF Data Science Centre's work will be made publicly available via this github repository.

All analysis plans, protocols and reports will be made publicly available via our [website](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/bhf-data-science-centre/) and/or the [HDR UK Gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/) (linking to additional institutional documentation if appropriate), and through open access publications.

Additional information on the data available for each of our projects can be found below.
